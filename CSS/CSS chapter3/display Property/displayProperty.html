    <!-- *Block and Inline Conclusions
        ?Block
            - Always start on a new line
            - Take up as much horizontal space as possible (the full width of the container or browser window if there is no container)
            - will respect width and height CSS properties
            - Horizontal and vertical margins both work
        
        ?Inline
            - Do not start on a new line
            - Only use as much horizontal space as required by the content. Do not accept width and height CSS properties.
            - Margins will work horizontally, but not vertically
            - padding works on all sides, but the top and bottom may overlap other elements.-->
